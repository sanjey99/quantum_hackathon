# ✅ How to Fix Error 003 WITHOUT "Entry Point" Field

## 🎯 The Problem

QCentroid doesn't have an "entry point" field in the solver registration form, but it needs to know which Python file to run. Currently it might be looking for:
- `main.py` (doesn't exist) ❌
- `quantum_solver.py` (not designed for QCentroid input) ❌
- Some other default file ❌

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Rename `qcentroid_main.py` to `main.py` (RECOMMENDED)

**This is the easiest fix!** Most platforms look for `main.py` by default.

### **What to do:**

1. **Rename the file:**
   ```bash
   git mv qcentroid_main.py main.py
   git commit -m "Rename qcentroid_main.py to main.py for platform compatibility"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **That's it!** QCentroid will automatically run `main.py`

3. **Retry your job** - No need to change any solver settings

### **Why this works:**
- ✅ Most quantum platforms default to `main.py`
- ✅ No configuration needed
- ✅ No need to edit solver registration
- ✅ Standard convention

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Add a `main.py` wrapper (ALTERNATIVE)

**If you want to keep `qcentroid_main.py`, create a simple `main.py` that calls it.**

### **Create this file: `main.py`**

```python
"""
Main entry point for QCentroid platform
Redirects to qcentroid_main.py
"""
import sys
from qcentroid_main import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main())
```

### **Then commit and push:**
```bash
git add main.py
git commit -m "Add main.py entry point for QCentroid"
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Create a Brand New Solver (FRESH START)

**If the current solver has issues, start fresh with corrected configuration.**

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean slate, no configuration conflicts
- ✅ Can use lessons learned from first attempt
- ✅ Original solver remains as backup

### **Steps:**

1. **First, make sure `main.py` exists** (use Solution 1 or 2 above)

2. **Push the changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Create a NEW solver on QCentroid with these settings:**

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | **SDK** | Qiskit |
   | **Provider** | QCentroid (or Microsoft if that's the only option) |
   | **Solver name** | DBS Fraud Detection QSVM v2 |
   | **Description** | Quantum SVM for fraud detection using Qiskit. Fixed entry point for QCentroid platform compatibility. |
   | **Solver URN** | dbs-fraud-qsvm-v2 |
   | **Type** | Quantum: Quantum circuit |
   | **Cost** | 50 |
   | **Branch** | main |
   | **Language** | Python |
   | **Repository** | quantum_hackathon |
   | **Git SSH URL** | git@github.com:sanjey99/quantum_hackathon.git |

4. **Add SSH key to GitHub** (if not done):
   - Go to: https://github.com/sanjey99/quantum_hackathon/settings/keys
   - Add the deploy key from QCentroid

5. **Create a new job** using the new solver

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Do Solution 1 First!

**Quickest path to success:**

```bash
# Just rename qcentroid_main.py to main.py
cd c:\Users\sanje\Documents\GitHub\quantum_hackathon
git mv qcentroid_main.py main.py
git commit -m "Rename to main.py for QCentroid default entry point"
git push origin main

# Then retry your existing job - should work!
```

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Takes 30 seconds
- ✅ No new solver needed
- ✅ Standard convention
- ✅ Works on most platforms

## 📊 What QCentroid is Probably Looking For

Most quantum platforms check for these files in order:

1. **`main.py`** ← Most common default
2. **`app.py`** ← Alternative
3. **`run.py`** ← Alternative
4. **`__main__.py`** ← Package entry point
5. **Custom entry point** (if specified somewhere)

**Since QCentroid registration doesn't have an entry point field, it's probably looking for `main.py`!**

---

## ✅ Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Solution 1 if:**
- ✅ You want the fastest fix
- ✅ You don't mind renaming the file
- ✅ You want standard conventions

**Choose Solution 2 if:**
- ✅ You want to keep `qcentroid_main.py` filename
- ✅ You want both files for clarity
- ✅ You might have other entry points later

**Choose Solution 3 if:**
- ✅ Your current solver has other issues
- ✅ You want a completely fresh start
- ✅ You want to keep the old solver as backup

---

## 🚀 Recommended Action NOW

```bash
# Execute these commands:
cd c:\Users\sanje\Documents\GitHub\quantum_hackathon
git mv qcentroid_main.py main.py
git commit -m "Rename to main.py - QCentroid default entry point"
git push origin main
```

**Then:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to update
2. Go back to QCentroid
3. Retry your job
4. Check the logs - should work now! ✅

## 💡 Why Error 003 Happened

```
QCentroid tried to run → Couldn't find entry point → Error 003
```

**Now with `main.py`:**
```
QCentroid tried to run → Found main.py → Execution starts → Success! ✅
```

---

**TL;DR: Rename `qcentroid_main.py` to `main.py` and push. That's it!** 🎯
