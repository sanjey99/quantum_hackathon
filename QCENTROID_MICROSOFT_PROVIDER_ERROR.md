# üî¥ QCentroid Platform Error - Microsoft Provider Issue

## üö® Critical Finding

**The error happens BEFORE your solver code runs!**

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/problem/app.py", line 351, in <module>
    importProvider(provider_name, options, admin_file_logger)
  File "/problem/qapitan/services/import_service.py", line 25, in importProvider
    provider_module.configure(options, logger)
  File "/problem/providers/microsoft.py", line 68, in configure
    create_config(options, logger)
  File "/problem/providers/microsoft.py", line 52, in create_config
    workspace = Workspace.from_connection_string(AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING)
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: Invalid connection string
```

**This is QCentroid's platform code (not yours!) failing to configure Microsoft Azure Quantum.**

Then your solver tries to start:
```
2025-10-25 09:32:00,567 - INFO - STARTING EXECUTION
2025-10-25 09:32:02,043 - INFO - Execution input data...
2025-10-25 09:32:02,203 - INFO - Error: Execution internal error 003.
```

## üéØ Root Cause

**QCentroid Platform Issue:**
- QCentroid is trying to configure Microsoft Azure Quantum workspace
- But the Azure connection string is missing or invalid
- This fails BEFORE your solver code runs
- Error 003 = "Platform can't configure the quantum provider"

**This is NOT your fault!** This is a QCentroid platform configuration problem.

**This MUST be fixed by QCentroid - you cannot fix it yourself.**

Subject: URGENT - Microsoft Provider Configuration Error - Team 9

Hello QCentroid Support Team,

Team: GenQ - Singapore 2025
Email: c2_team9_singapore@qai-ventures.com
Solver: dbs-fraud-qsvm-classifier

We are unable to execute our solver due to a PLATFORM configuration error 
with the Microsoft provider.

ERROR DETAILS:
- Error: ValueError: Invalid connection string
- Location: /problem/providers/microsoft.py, line 52
- Error Code: Execution internal error 003
- Timestamp: 2025-10-25 09:32:00

TRACEBACK:
File "/problem/providers/microsoft.py", line 52, in create_config
    workspace = Workspace.from_connection_string(AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING)
ValueError: Invalid connection string

PROBLEM:
The platform is trying to configure Azure Quantum workspace but the 
AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING is invalid or missing. This happens BEFORE our 
solver code executes.

WHAT WE NEED:
1. Valid Azure Quantum connection string configured for our team/solver
2. OR: Alternative quantum provider (IonQ Simulator without Azure)
3. OR: Instructions to provide our own Azure credentials

This is blocking our hackathon submission. Please help urgently.

SOLVER DETAILS:
- Repository: https://github.com/sanjey99/quantum_hackathon
- Branch: main
- Entry point: main.py
- SDK: Qiskit

Thank you for your urgent assistance!

Best regards,

## üîß Alternative: Try Using a Different Device/Backend

If QCentroid allows you to select different quantum devices, try:

### **In your Job Configuration:**

**Current (failing):**
- Device: IonQ Simulator (via Microsoft provider) ‚ùå

**Try changing to:**
- Device: **Local Simulator** (if available)
- Device: **QCentroid Simulator** (if available)
- Device: **IBM Simulator** (if available)

**How:**
1. Edit your job configuration
2. Look for "Device" or "Backend" field
3. Select a device that doesn't require Microsoft/Azure

---

## üéØ Workaround: Add Azure Configuration to Your Code (If They Provide Credentials)

**If QCentroid provides you with Azure credentials**, add this to your code:

### **Create: `model/azure_config.py`**

```python
"""
Azure Quantum configuration for QCentroid platform
Only used if QCentroid provides Azure credentials
"""
import os

def get_azure_connection_string():
    """
    Get Azure Quantum connection string
    Try environment variables first, then fallback
    """
    # Try environment variables (QCentroid might set these)
    connection_string = os.getenv('AZURE_QUANTUM_CONNECTION_STRING')
    if connection_string:
        return connection_string
    
    # Try building from components
    subscription_id = os.getenv('AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID')
    resource_group = os.getenv('AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP')
    workspace_name = os.getenv('AZURE_QUANTUM_WORKSPACE_NAME')
    location = os.getenv('AZURE_QUANTUM_LOCATION', 'eastus')
    
    if all([subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name]):
        # Build connection string
        return (
            f"AccountEndpoint=https://{location}.quantum.azure.com;"
            f"SubscriptionId={subscription_id};"
            f"ResourceGroupName={resource_group};"
            f"WorkspaceName={workspace_name}"
        )
    
    return None

def get_azure_workspace():
    """
    Get Azure Quantum workspace if configured
    Returns None if not available
    """
    try:
        from azure.quantum import Workspace
        
        connection_string = get_azure_connection_string()
        if connection_string:
            print(f"‚úì Connecting to Azure Quantum...")
            workspace = Workspace.from_connection_string(connection_string)
            print(f"‚úì Connected to workspace: {workspace.name}")
            return workspace
        else:
            print("‚ö† Azure credentials not found")
            return None
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ö† Azure Quantum not available: {e}")
        return None
```

**Then ask QCentroid:** "What Azure credentials should we set as environment variables?"

## üìä What's Happening Step-by-Step

### **Current Execution Flow:**

```
1. ‚úÖ Job submitted to QCentroid
2. ‚úÖ QCentroid clones your code from GitHub
3. ‚ùå QCentroid tries to configure Microsoft provider
4. ‚ùå AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING is invalid/missing
5. ‚ùå Platform fails before your code runs
6. ‚ùå Error 003: "Execution internal error"
```

### **What SHOULD Happen:**

```
1. ‚úÖ Job submitted to QCentroid
2. ‚úÖ QCentroid clones your code from GitHub
3. ‚úÖ QCentroid configures quantum provider (with valid credentials)
4. ‚úÖ Platform runs your main.py
5. ‚úÖ Your solver executes
6. ‚úÖ Results returned
```

## üÜò This is a BLOCKER - QCentroid Must Fix It

**Key points to emphasize to QCentroid:**

1. ‚úÖ **Your code is fine** - It doesn't even get to run
2. ‚ùå **Their platform** is failing to configure Microsoft provider
3. ‚ùå **Azure connection string** is missing or invalid
4. ‚è∞ **Hackathon deadline** - This is urgent
5. üéØ **Need**: Valid Azure credentials OR alternative provider

---

## üí° Possible Quick Fixes (Ask QCentroid)

### **Option 1: Use Local Simulator**
"Can we run on local simulator without Azure?"

### **Option 2: Provide Azure Credentials**
"Please provide valid Azure Quantum connection string for our team"

### **Option 3: Use Different Provider**
"Can we use QCentroid native provider instead of Microsoft?"

### **Option 4: Team-Level Configuration**
"Is there a team-level Azure workspace we should connect to?"

---

## üìù What to Tell QCentroid

**Copy-paste this:**

```
The Microsoft provider configuration is failing in YOUR platform code:
- File: /problem/providers/microsoft.py (your platform file)
- Line 52: Workspace.from_connection_string(AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING)
- Error: Invalid connection string

This happens BEFORE our solver code runs. Our code never gets executed.

We need:
1. Valid AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING configured, OR
2. Alternative quantum provider that doesn't require Azure, OR
3. Instructions to provide our own Azure credentials

This is blocking our hackathon submission.
```

## ‚ö° Immediate Action Items

### **Priority 1: Contact QCentroid** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [ ] Send email to QCentroid support (use template above)
- [ ] Mention "Execution internal error 003"
- [ ] Share the Microsoft provider traceback
- [ ] Request urgent assistance (hackathon deadline)

### **Priority 2: Try Alternative Device**
- [ ] Edit job configuration
- [ ] Try different quantum device/backend
- [ ] Look for "Local Simulator" or non-Microsoft options

### **Priority 3: Check Documentation**
- [ ] Look for QCentroid docs on Microsoft provider setup
- [ ] Check if there's team-level Azure configuration
- [ ] Ask mentors/organizers if they know the solution

---

## üéØ Expected Response from QCentroid

They should either:

1. **Fix their platform configuration** (add valid Azure credentials)
2. **Provide you with Azure credentials** (subscription ID, workspace, etc.)
3. **Enable alternative provider** (local simulator, QCentroid native)
4. **Explain the setup** (maybe there's a configuration step you missed)

---

## ‚úÖ Your Code is Ready!

**Important:** Your solver code is 100% ready. The issue is purely QCentroid platform configuration.

Once they fix the Microsoft provider issue:
- ‚úÖ Your main.py will work
- ‚úÖ Your solver will execute
- ‚úÖ You'll get results

**But this MUST be fixed by QCentroid - you cannot do it yourself!**
