## 🎯 What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### **Step 1: Update Solver Entry Point on QCentroid**

1. **Go to your solver on QCentroid platform**
2. **Click "Edit Solver"** (or equivalent button)
3. **Find these fields and update them:**

   **Main File / Entry Point:**
   ```
   qcentroid_main.py
   ```

   **Command to Run:**
   ```
   python qcentroid_main.py
   ```

   **Or if there's a single "Command" field:**
   ```
   python qcentroid_main.py
   ```

4. **Save the changes**

---

### **Step 2: Retry Your Job**

1. **Go back to Jobs**
2. **Create a new job** (or retry the failed one)
3. **Use the same configuration:**
   - Hardware: 4 vCPU & 8 GB memory
   - Device: IonQ Simulator (or whatever is available)
   - Shots: 1
   - Max time: 60 minutes

4. **Submit the job**

## 🔍 What This Fix Does

The new `qcentroid_main.py` entry point:

✅ **Accepts input from QCentroid** (your dataset JSON is being passed!)
✅ **Handles missing data** (downloads if needed)
✅ **Better error handling** (shows exactly what goes wrong)
✅ **Compatible with QCentroid format** (proper stdin/stdout handling)
✅ **Works with Microsoft provider** (falls back to local simulator if needed)

## 📊 Expected Execution Log After Fix

You should see this instead of Error 003:

## ⚠️ If It Still Fails

### **Check these common issues:**

1. **Requirements.txt missing packages?**
   - Make sure all dependencies are listed
   - Check: qiskit, qiskit-aer, qiskit-ibm-runtime, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.

2. **Data files missing?**
   - The solver will try to download data automatically
   - But it needs `kaggle` package and may need credentials

3. **Microsoft provider needs Azure credentials?**
   - Contact QCentroid support
   - Ask them to provide Azure Quantum access or enable local simulator

## 🆘 Support Email Template

If it still doesn't work, email QCentroid:

```
Subject: Solver Error 003 - Need Help with Microsoft Provider

Hi QCentroid Team,

Team: GenQ - Singapore 2025 (c2_team9_singapore@qai-ventures.com)
Solver: dbs-fraud-qsvm-classifier

We updated our solver entry point to qcentroid_main.py but still getting 
"Execution internal error 003".

Could you help us with:
1. What credentials are needed for Microsoft provider?
2. Or can you enable local simulator mode?
3. Or provide access logs so we can see the actual error?

The solver works locally but fails on the platform.

Thank you!
Team 9
