## üìã Form Fields & Answers

### **SDK** *
```
Qiskit
```
**Explanation:** Your solver uses Qiskit (IBM's quantum computing SDK) for quantum circuit creation, QSVM implementation, and quantum kernel computation.

---

### **Provider** *
```
QCentroid
```
**Explanation:** The solver runs on QCentroid's quantum hardware infrastructure, which provides access to IBM quantum computers and simulators.

---

### **Solver name** *
```
DBS Fraud Detection QSVM
```
**Explanation:** This is the readable display name. Uses capital letters and spaces as allowed.

**Alternative names (if you prefer):**
- `Quantum Fraud Detection Solver`
- `Credit Card Fraud QSVM Detector`
- `DBS Quantum Fraud Classifier`

---

### **Description** *
```
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for credit card fraud detection using real quantum computing. This solver processes transaction data from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset, applies quantum feature selection, and trains a QSVM classifier with quantum kernels on QCentroid hardware. Uses ZZFeatureMap for quantum state encoding and implements quantum kernel estimation. Detects fraudulent transactions by leveraging quantum computing's ability to explore high-dimensional feature spaces. Returns fraud predictions with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Processes 500 training samples and 200 test samples per execution, with quantum circuit execution on IBM quantum backends.
```
**Character count:** 670/1000 ‚úÖ

**Shorter alternative (if needed):**
```
Quantum SVM for fraud detection using Qiskit on QCentroid hardware. Trains on Kaggle credit card fraud data with quantum kernels and ZZFeatureMap encoding. Detects fraudulent transactions using quantum computing to explore high-dimensional feature spaces. Returns predictions with performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). Executes quantum circuits on IBM backends via QCentroid platform.
```
**Character count:** 396/1000 ‚úÖ

---

### **Solver URN** *
```
dbs-fraud-qsvm-classifier
```
**Explanation:** Unique identifier without spaces or special characters. This will be used in API calls.

**Alternative URNs (if first is taken):**
- `quantum-fraud-detection-qsvm`
- `qsvm-fraud-detector-dbs`
- `fraud-qsvm-team9-singapore`
- `creditcard-fraud-qsvm`

---

### **Type of solver** *
```
Quantum: Quantum circuit
```
**Explanation:** Your solver uses Qiskit to create and execute quantum circuits for QSVM with quantum kernels. It builds quantum circuits using ZZFeatureMap and executes them on quantum hardware.

**Why this is the correct choice:**
- ‚úÖ You create quantum circuits with Qiskit
- ‚úÖ You execute these circuits on QCentroid quantum backends
- ‚úÖ QSVM uses quantum circuits for kernel estimation
- ‚úÖ Not purely analog, annealing, or tensor network based

**Alternative if needed:**
- `Hybrid: Hybrid quantum circuit` (if you consider the classical SVM training as hybrid)
- `Quantum inspired: Quantum circuit simulation` (only if running on simulator, not real hardware)

---

### **Estimated cost** *
```
50
```
**Explanation:** Cost in credits per execution. This is an estimate for:
- Quantum circuit execution (~500 quantum kernel computations)
- Training QSVM on 500 samples
- Testing on 200 samples
- Approximate runtime: 15-30 minutes

**Cost reasoning:**
- Quantum kernel matrix computation requires significant quantum resources
- Multiple quantum circuit executions (one per training pair)
- Consider adjusting after first run based on actual consumption

**Alternative costs:**
- `25` credits (if 50 seems high)
- `100` credits (if quantum hardware is heavily used)
- `75` credits (mid-range estimate)

---

### **Branch/tag** *
```
main
```
**Explanation:** Your cleaned, optimized code is now on the `main` branch after the recent merge.

**Alternative (if you want to keep development separate):**
- `production` (create this branch for stable releases)
- `v1.0` (create a version tag)
- `sanjey_challenge_demo_fix` (if you want to use your dev branch)

---

### **Programming language** *
```
Python
```
**Explanation:** Your entire solver is written in Python 3.

---

### **Repository name** *
```
quantum_hackathon
```
**Explanation:** Your GitHub repository name in lowercase with underscore. Only lowercase letters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed.

**Alternative names (if you want to create a new repo):**
- `quantum-hackathon` (with hyphen)
- `dbs-fraud-qsvm`
- `fraud-detection-quantum`
- `qsvm-fraud-detector`

---

### **Git repository SSH URL** *
```
git@github.com:sanjey99/quantum_hackathon.git
```
**Explanation:** The SSH URL for your GitHub repository. QCentroid will use this to clone your code.

**Alternative formats if needed:**
- HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/sanjey99/quantum_hackathon.git`
- If using SSH: `git@github.com:sanjey99/quantum_hackathon.git` ‚úÖ (Recommended)

**Note:** Make sure QCentroid has access to your repository:
- If **public repository** ‚Üí Still need to add deploy key (see below)
- If **private repository** ‚Üí Must add QCentroid's SSH key or deploy key to your repo
